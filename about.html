        <p>This a site that I made just for fun, to test my programming acumen. Querying the OMDb API, which queries the IMDb. Originally I wanted to build a site that would screen movies based on genre, release year, and IMDb rating, ex: "Comedies from 2010 - 2020 that are above a 7/10."</p>

        <p>But, the OMDb API doesn't support screening, you can only look up a single movie at a time--like the IMDb site, which kinda defeats the whole point of the thing...  </p>
